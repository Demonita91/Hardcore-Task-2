Hey Everybody

We`ve all got troubles
We all make mistakes
But let`s not take a little river turn it into lake
We`ve all been humble
We`ve lost and we`ve found
But it can never get the best of us if we`re not looking down
And I wonder, are there others like me
Yeah I wonder
I`ve got the whole world left to see

Hey everybody if you listen to the beat
We`ll celebrate it
Now I stumble at feet
Hey everybody do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty why we`re keeping it clean
Na na na na ...
You got it bad well she`s got it work
She`s got no chocolate in the bank account no cheese in the purse
You`re feeling connected with no self-esteem
Just when you finally found you`re glad that someone`s taking a cling
When you wonder why is life this way
Yes you wonder
Could there be a brighter day
Hey everybody if you listen to the beat
We`ll celebrate it
Now I stumble at feet
Hey everybody do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty why we`re keeping it clean
Na na na na ...
