Hey Everybody

We`ve all got troubles
We all make mistakes
But let`s not take a little river turn it into lake
We`ve all been humble
We`ve lost and we`ve found
But it can never get the best of us if we`re not looking down
And I wonder, are there others like me
Yeah I wonder
I`ve got the whole world left to see

Hey everybody if you listen to the beat
We`ll celebrate it
Now I stumble at feet
Hey everybody do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty why we`re keeping it clean
Na na na na ...
You got it bad well she`s got it work
She`s got no chocolate in the bank account no cheese in the purse
You`re feeling connected with no self-esteem
Just when you finally found you`re glad that someone`s taking a cling
When you wonder why is life this way
Yes you wonder
Could there be a brighter day
Hey everybody if you listen to the beat
We`ll celebrate it
Now I stumble at feet
Hey everybody do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty why we`re keeping it clean
Na na na na ...

And I wonder, wonder now
And I wonder, wonder now
Everybody won`t you help me sing it one more time
So that everyone can hear you
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Hey everybody if you listen to the beat
We`ll celebrate it
Now I stumble at feet
Hey everybody do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty why we`re keeping it clean
Hey everybody if we`re gonna take a stand
Now let the world hear you now while clapping your hands
Hey everybody if you listen to the beat
Let the world hear you now but stopping your feet
I say hey
Na ...
Let`s celebrate here
Let me hear you stop your feet one more time
Na...
Hey everybody, Hey everybody
