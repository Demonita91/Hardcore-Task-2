Hey Everybody

We`ve all got troubles
We all make mistakes
But let`s not take a little river turn it into lake
We`ve all been humble
We`ve lost and we`ve found
But it can never get the best of us if we`re not looking down
And I wonder, are there others like me
Yeah I wonder
I`ve got the whole world left to see

Hey everybody if you listen to the beat
We`ll celebrate it
Now I stumble at feet
Hey everybody do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty why we`re keeping it clean
Na na na na ...
You got it bad well she`s got it work
She`s got no chocolate in the bank account no cheese in the purse
You`re feeling connected with no self-esteem
Just when you finally found you`re glad that someone`s taking a cling
When you wonder why is life this way
Yes you wonder
Could there be a brighter day
Hey everybody if you listen to the beat
We`ll celebrate it
Now I stumble at feet
Hey everybody do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty why we`re keeping it clean
Na na na na ...

And I wonder, wonder now
And I wonder, wonder now
Everybody won`t you help me sing it one more time
So that everyone can hear you
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Hey everybody if you listen to the beat
We`ll celebrate it
Now I stumble at feet
Hey everybody do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty why we`re keeping it clean
Hey everybody if we`re gonna take a stand
Now let the world hear you now while clapping your hands
Hey everybody if you listen to the beat
Let the world hear you now but stopping your feet
I say hey
Na ...
Let`s celebrate here
Let me hear you stop your feet one more time
Na...
Hey everybody, Hey everybody

Second song

I Can Do Better

Uh, yeah you can do it

I didn′t give a damn what you say to me
I don′t really care what you think of me
Cus either way you′re gonna think what you believe
There′s nothing you could say that would hurt me

I′m better off without you anyway
I thought it would be hard but I′m ok
I don′t need you if you′re gonna be that way
Because with me, it′s all or nothing

I′m sick of this shit, don′t deny
You′re a waste of time
I′m sick of this shit, don′t ask why

[Chorus]
I hate you now
So go away from me
You′re gone, so long
I can do better, I can do better
Hey, hey you
I found myself again
That′s why you′re gone
I can do better, I can do better

You′re so full of it
I can′t stand the way you act
I just can′t comprehend
I don′t think that you can handle it
I′m way over, over it

I will drink as much lemoncello as I can
And I′ll do again and again
I don′t really care what you have to say
Cus you know, you know you′re nothing

(I′m so sick)
I′m sick of your shit, don′t deny
You′re a waste of time
I′m sick of your shit, don′t ask why

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
What′d you say
I told you so
You know that
Cus I always know
Get outta my face
Hey hey
You′re not my taste
Hey hey
I am so
Sick of you
You wanted this(?)
I wanted you(?)
Get outta my face
Hey hey
You′re not my taste
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
